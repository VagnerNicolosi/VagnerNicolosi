# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github.
<p>I'm Vagner, and technology has been my world since I was 11 years oldâ€”living it, studying it, and working with it.
<br>My passion for computers, however, sparked before I was even 9.</p>
<p>To learn more about me, feel free to check out my personal website and LinkedIn.</p>
It's a pleasure sharing this corner of spacetime with you!
<br>And always remember: grab your towel, and may the Force be with you.
